The moliz-codegen project evaluates the potential and limitations of using the moliz project, in particular its virtual machine, for code generation.


The moliz-codegen project is done as part of the advanced model engineering course 2013 under guidance of the Business Informatics Group, a research group of the Institute of Software Technology and Interactive Systems at the Vienna University of Technology.
